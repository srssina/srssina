# üí´ About Me:
Hey there, I'm an amateur CS student with a growing interest in AI and machine learning. Although I don't have a lot of practical experience yet, I do have a solid academic background in computer science.<br><br>In my studies, I've learned the foundational concepts and programming skills needed, and I'm now applying these skills to my exploration of AI and machine learning.<br><br>Although I'm still working on mastering math skills like linear algebra and statistics, I understand the importance of these topics for the field of AI and machine learning. I'm working hard to develop my understanding in these areas, and I'm excited to see where it takes me.<br><br>On my GitHub profile, you'll find a few small projects that I've been working on in my free time. While they may not be perfect, I'm proud of the work I've done and the things I've learned along the way.<br><br>When I'm not studying or coding, I enjoy reading articles and watching videos about AI and machine learning. I find it fascinating how this technology can be used to solve real-world problems and improve people's lives.<br><br>If you'd like to connect with me and talk about AI and machine learning, feel free to reach out! I'm always open to learning from others and sharing my own experiences.
